## Important Notes

MIT License: A permissive license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software with minimal restrictions, provided the copyright notice and permission notice are included.
GPL v3.0: A copyleft license that requires any derivative works or distributions of the src/client code to also be licensed under GPL v3.0 or later, ensuring that the source code remains open and freely available.
If you are combining code from src/client (GPL) with other parts of the project (MIT), the GPL’s copyleft requirements may affect the licensing of the combined work. Consult a legal expert for specific guidance.
For contributions to src/client, ensure that all contributors agree to the GPL v3.0 terms.
